## Machine Learning Repo For Stock Prediction App Using Machine Learning
**This Repo stores the machine learning part of a Fullstack Web application that employs Machine Learning and AI to predict stock prices of major companies in the United States.**    
**It runs on microservice architecture.**   
**There are 4 microservics in all as stated below**  
1. The **Frontend** being **React**
2. The **Backend / API** being **Django Rest Framework** 
3. The Model was hosted on **huggingface** and served using **FastAPI**
4. It carried out **deep learning** for the **machine learning** using **Neural Networks** and **LSTM** 

### Frontend
- It employs **JWT** stored as **http only cookie** for user authentication
- It uses **Formik** along with **Yup** for form handling and validation
- It utilizes **React-Router** for routing pages
- it load chart from cloudinary. this charts are dynamically generated by the backend and saved in cloudinary for quick access
- Frontend was deployed to **Netlify**

### Backend - API
- it uses django rest framework
- It employs JWT stored as http only cookie for authentication
- It uses custom Authentication class
- it dynamically generates chart from the machine learning model and stores in **cloudinary** for faster access
- The backend was deployed on **Render**

### Machine Learning
- it uses Neural Network - LSTM for prediction
- Data was splitted into training data, validation data and test data in the ratio 60%, 20%, and 20% respectively
- It made use of scikit-learn, tensorflow and keras libraries
- It generates useful charts for better insight into how well the model did using matplotlib

### Artificial Intelligence
- The project was hosted on huggingface spaces
- An API application was developed using FastAPI to serve the model

### Model Evaluation
> The model performed very well when evaluated
- The **Mean Square Error(MSE)** of the model is 15.23
- The **Root Mean Square Error(RMSE)** of the model is 15.23
- The **R-Squared (R2)** is **0.98**
